################################

# a) What are the individuals in this data set?
# Ans. Cars

# b) For each individual, what variables are given? Which of these variables are
#    categorical and which are quantitative?
# Ans. 6 variables -- Categorial: Make and Model, Vehicle Type, Tranmission Type, Number of Cylinders
#                  -- Quantitative: City MPG, Highway MPG

# c) Present City MPG data in a well-labelled bar graph.

make.and.model <-
  c('BMW 3181', 'BMW 3181', 'Buick Century', 'Chevrolet Blazer')
vehicle.type <-
  c('Subcompact', 'Subcompact', 'Midsize', 'Four-wheel drive')
trans.type <- c('Automatic', 'Maual', 'Automatic', 'Automatic')
num.cyl <- c(4, 4, 6, 6)
city.mpg <- c(22, 23, 20, 16)
high.mpg <- c(31, 32, 29, 30)

(
  cars.data <- data.frame(
    'Make and Model' = make.and.model,
    'Vehicle Type' = vehicle.type,
    'Transmission Type' = trans.type,
    'Number of Cylinders' = num.cyl,
    'City MPG' = city.mpg,
    'Highway MPG' = high.mpg
  )
)

(
  barplot(
    cars.data$City.MPG,
    beside = TRUE,
    ylim = c(0, 30),
    main = "Fuel Economy of 1998 cars",
    font.main = 4,
    names.arg = cars.data$Make.and.Model,
    sub = "Question 1 - Section C",
    ylab = "City MPG"
  )
)

# d) Would it also be correct to use a pie chart to display these data? If so,
#    construct the pie chart. If not, explain why not.
# Ans. Although, pie chart can be created, the law of pie chart is the percentage
#      must add up to 100%

# calculate percentage
cars.data$City.MPG / sum(cars.data$City.MPG)
sum(cars.data$City.MPG / sum(cars.data$City.MPG))

# or use this to find percentage
prop.table(cars.data$City.MPG)

# plot a pie chart
pie(cars.data$City.MPG, labels = cars.data$Make.and.Model)

################################

# a) Load the file tyres.csv into R
tyres <- read.csv('tyres.csv')
library(dplyr)
tyres <- arrange(.data = tyres, order(Distance...kms.))

# b) Produce a well labelled and presented scatter graph of the data, displaying
#    the trend line
x <- tyres$Distance...kms.
y <- tyres$Tread..mm.
relation <- lm(y ~ x)

plot(
  tyres$Distance...kms.,
  tyres$Tread..mm.,
  abline(relation),
  xlab = 'Distance (km)',
  ylab = 'Tread (mm)',
  main = 'Tyre Change Estimation',
  sub = 'Queston 2 - Section b'
)

## Alternative solution
library(ggplot2)
(
  ggplot(data = tyres, aes(
    x = tyres$Distance...kms., y = tyres$Tread..mm.
  ))
  + geom_point()
  + geom_smooth()
  + xlab('Distance (km)')
  + ylab('Tread (mm)')
  + ggtitle('Estimated Tyre Tread vs Distance travelled')
)



# c) If the tyre travels 16 thousand kmâ€™s what
#   would the forecasted tread be?
distance <- data.frame(x = 16000)
predict(relation, distance)




# d) Government regulations state that minimum tread is 4mm. What is the
#    forecasted maximum distance you could travel on one set of tyres?
relation2 <- lm(x ~ y)
tread <- data.frame(y = 4)
predict(relation2, tread)

######### Question 3 ###########
################################

# a) Load the faithful data set that is built in to R.
faithful.data <- faithful


### b) Plot the data and then briefly describe the dataset
plot(x = faithful.data, main = 'Old Faithful Geyser', sub = 'Yellowstone National Club, WY, USA')
# Describe: 2 quantatitive variables, 272 observations


# c) Summarise the data and calculate the
# Minimum value : 1.600 and 43.0
# 1st Quartile:   2.163 and 58.0
# Median:         4.000 and 76.0
# 3rd Quartile:   4.454 and 82.0
# Maximum Value:  5.100 and 96.0
summary(faithful.data)

#### alternative solution ####

# find min values
min(faithful.data$eruptions)
min(faithful.data$waiting)

# find 1st and 3rd quartile values
quantile(faithful.data$eruptions)
quantile(faithful.data$waiting)

# find median values
median(faithful.data$eruptions)
median(faithful.data$waiting)

# find max values
max(faithful.data$eruptions)
max(faithful.data$waiting)


# d) Calculate the standard deviations of the waiting time between eruptions. Can
#    we assume a constant spread across the groups make a brief note.
sd(faithful.data$waiting)
# ??

######### Question 4 ###########
################################

# a) Import data from the countries.csv file
countries <- read.csv('countries.csv')


# b) Apply k-means to the data, and store the clustering result (ensure you set the
#    correct number of clusters)
set.seed(18)
kc <- kmeans(countries[, 2:5], centers = 3)

# c) Print the components of for the k-Means operation(print)
print(kc)

# d) Plot the clusters and their centres for the first two dimensions: per capita
#    income and literacy.
## clusters
plot(
  countries[, c(3,2)],
  col = kc$cluster,
  xlab = "Literacy rate",
  ylab = "Per capita income",
  main = "Literacy rate vs Per capita income"
)
# points(kc$centers, pch=19,cex=1.5, col=1:100)


library(cluster)
clusplot(countries[,-1],  kc$cluster)

## ????????? assign centers and clusters in one plot ???????

# e) Plot the clusters for all dimensions displayed in a single graph (similar to
#    below)
plot(
  countries[, -1],
  col = kc$cluster,
  main = "kmeans clustering"
)

# f) Briefly discuss the clusters that were generated
#   and the countries that are in each cluster are they
#   homogeneous did the clustering algorithm work?

# RED signifies developed
# BLACK signifies emerging
# GREEN signifies underdeveloped

o <- order(kc$cluster)
data.frame(countries$Country[o], kc$cluster[o])
# RED(2) = Germany, Australia, UK, Sweden, Greece, Italy, Japan
# BLACK(1) = Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Turkey, Lithuania,
# GREEN(3) = Mozambique, China, Zambia, Namibia, Georgia, Pakistan, India

# In my opinion the clustering algorithm worked because
# a) cluster shown correlates with the relationships for each criteria
# b) RED, BLACK and GREEN are apart from each other
# c) The more income the higher literacy rate, higher life expcectancy and lower infant mortality
